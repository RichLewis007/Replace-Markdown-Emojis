## Migration Guide

### From Legacy Setup to Modern Development

#### Before (Legacy)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### After (Modern)
```bash
uv sync --dev
python dev.py install
python dev.py all
```

### Development Workflow Changes

#### Old Workflow
```bash
# Manual formatting
black .
flake8 .
pytest
```

#### New Workflow
```bash
# Automated quality checks
python dev.py all
# Or individual tasks
python dev.py format
python dev.py lint
python dev.py test
```
