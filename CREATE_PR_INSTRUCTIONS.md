## For Individual PRs per Commit (Advanced)

If you want separate PRs for each feature commit (not recommended):

### Option 1: Cherry-pick approach

1. Create feature branches from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b feature/database
   git cherry-pick aded8b7
   git push origin feature/database
   # Create PR for this branch
   
   # After merging first PR:
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/init-db
   git cherry-pick ca6bbb0
   git push origin feature/init-db
   # Create PR for this branch
   
   # Repeat for remaining commits...
   ```

2. Create PRs in sequence, merging each before the next

### Option 2: Incremental branches (cleaner)

This requires recreating the commit history in separate branches, which is complex. The single comprehensive PR is the recommended approach.

---

## Merging the PR

Once the PR is created and reviewed:

1. Click **"Merge pull request"**
2. Choose merge method:
   - **Create a merge commit** (recommended - preserves all commits)
   - Squash and merge (combines all commits into one)
   - Rebase and merge (linear history)
3. Click **"Confirm merge"**
4. Delete the `dev` branch if desired (optional)

---

## Verification After Merge

After merging:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git log --oneline
```

You should see all 6 commits merged into main.
